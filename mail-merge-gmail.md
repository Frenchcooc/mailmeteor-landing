## What is a mail merge?

It's common for people to want to send emails and documents to multiple recipients with information that is customized to each. Let’s say you want to send an email to all your customers, students, or employees. Manually composing emails for each person would take a long time. Instead, you can let your computer do the heavy lifting. That’s a mail merge.

When referring to emails, mail merge lets you email multiple recipients without them knowing they’re part of a mailing list. Instead of having to write each email individually or put everyone in BCC, a mail merge automatically sends personalized emails on your behalf. Each of your recipients will receive a dedicated personalized email.
