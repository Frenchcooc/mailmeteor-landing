description: "This add-on enables the addition of Jewish texts into Google Docs by direct reference (e.g. Exodus 12:8) or by search term (e.g. \"Abraham\"), with more functionality forthcoming. These texts are pulled from the Sefaria Library of Jewish Texts (sefaria.org), an open-source project aiming to translate all of the major Jewish texts, interlink them, and provide an interface online to access them."
